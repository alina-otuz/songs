Timeless - The Weeknd feat. Playboi Carti

[Verse 2: The Weeknd & Playboi Carti]
Oh, city on fire when I'm comin' home
Fill up the sky (Yeah), I fill up the Dome
They'll play it one day (Yeah), it's a hell of a show
But it's gonna hurt 'cause we did it first
Feel like Skateboard P, BBC boys on the creep
Feel like it's '03, Neptune drum with a beam (Yeah)
She hippie-flippin' a bean, she wanna fuck with the team
She fell in love with the cream (Yeah), she fell in love with the scene
Ooh, yeah, her man quiet, not a peep (Oh, nah)
Broke his heart, PTSD (Oh, nah)
Hold his chest, let it breathe
Let it breathe, niggas scheme
And I got a priest, he got a cross
Get out of line, send him to God
I shed a tear, pray for a loss, ooh, yeah (Yeah)

[Third verse: The Weeknd & Playboi Carti]
Timeless (Oh), timeless, timeless
Timeless, timeless, timeless, we timeless, oh
Timeless, timeless, timeless (Yeah), timeless
Timeless (Yeah), timeless, timeless, we timeless, oh
Oh (Blatt)
Oh (Yuh, lit)
